    <h2>USES OF A LIBRARY</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">Meet with friends</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Libraries used to be strictly quiet places. Reading rooms had large tables in them, where readers could get serious work done. Librarians actively discouraged conversations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Use it as an office</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lots of people hang out at Panera, Starbucks, and other places to use the free wi-fi. People who work from home using a computer can go there for a break and get lots accomplished.
                    Self-employed people can meet clients. The stores don’t care how long people stay at a table, so long as they spend some money.
                    The library has all the same advantages and more. The chairs are more comfortable and the tables larger. Even though libraries don’t enforce absolute stillness any more, they’re still quieter than a restaurant.
                    Even though you don’t have to feel obligated to spend money, many libraries now have coffee shops. You can even take food and drink to at least some other places in the library. </li>
            </ul>
             
            <p class="paragraph">Ask a question</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Reference librarian and patron
                    Reference interview
                    Librarians specialize in connecting you with the information you need. Or the entertainment.
                    You may have a very simple question, or a very complicated one. You may have a research question or just a recommendation for a novel you’ll enjoy.
                    You may just go up to the reference desk, or you may make an appointment to talk with a specialist. It doesn’t matter.
                    The librarian will conduct a “reference interview” to get a clear idea of what you’re looking for. It will give you a clearer idea, too.
                    Here’s the beauty of the modern library: you don’t even have to go into the library itself to ask a librarian. You can talk on the phone, chat by instant messenger, or send an email.
                    </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">Find a job</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you’re looking for work, the library can help you. Perhaps, instead of looking for a job, you’re thinking of starting a business. You can find all you need to know at the library.
                    It has all kinds of information about the job market and how to write your resume. Very likely, it hosts an unemployment support group. At the very least, it will have at least one librarian who can help you navigate through the sheer bulk of what you need to keep in mind.
                    </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">Use a computer</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can take your own (did I mention free wi-fi?) or use one of the library’s computers. In either case, the library has resources you don’t have yourself.
                Some people don’t know how to use computers at all. The library has tutorials and friendly staff to help them learn.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Use software</p>
            <ul>
             <li> You have software on your computer, and you know how to use it, but that’s software you use all the time. You may not often need software for such tasks as database construction or photo manipulation. When you do need specialized software, it has a high learning curve, not to mention high expense.
             So go to the library. Someone will be happy to show you how to use it. If more than one application does what you need, you can see which one you like best. If ever you decide to buy it, you have already learned what you can do with it.</li>
             </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">Use the copier and other machines and gadgets</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Just like software, you probably own a printer or other tool you use frequently. Modern printers double as scanners, copiers, or even fax machines. Sometimes, though, you need more.
                    The library has larger, more heavy-duty copiers and scanners. It may have a color copier or 3D printer. Or perhaps you can scan library materials and email a PDF to yourself.The library also has simpler, more common gadgets, like e-book readers, for people who don’t own them. Again, you can try before you buy.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Find reliable information</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whatever your interest, search engines will show you millions of websites in seconds. Who wants to wade through all of that? And a search engine can’t assess how useful or reliable the the pages are that it returns.Librarians can help you find not just information, but reliable, useful information. They will can help you refine your question so that you understand what you want and need more clearly. If they start their search on the web, they’ll probably think of better keywords than you will.</li>
            </ul>
